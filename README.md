# Basic-Electronics-Projects-7-Segment-Display-Counter
"This project demonstrates the use of a 7-segment display to visually represent numerical digits (0-9) using LEDs arranged in a figure-8 pattern. The display is controlled by a circuit that activates specific segments to form numbers, ideal for counters, timers, and basic electronics applications."
